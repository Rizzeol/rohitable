Hello! I'm Rohit, Computer Science Graudate from [Jacobs University, Bremen](https://www.jacobs-university.de). I enjoy building things that live on the internet and serve people. I develop exceptional websites and web apps that provide interactive interfaces with efficient and modern backends.

I have keen interested in solving real life problems with modern technologies. I like doing robotics and automation and consider it my hobby :)
