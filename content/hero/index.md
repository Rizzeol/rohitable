I'm 3rd year Computer Science student at [Jacobs University, Bremen](https://www.jacobs-university.de)and part-time software engineer at [Digital Guest Solutions](https://guest-solutions.com) based in Bremen, Germany. I enjoy building things that live on the internet and serve people. I develop exceptional websites and web apps that provide interactive interfaces with efficient and modern backends.
